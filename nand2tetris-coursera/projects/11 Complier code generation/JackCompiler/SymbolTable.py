class SymbolTable:
    """
    A symbol table that associates names with information needed for Jack compilation: type, kind, and
    running index. The symbol table has 2 nested scopes (class/subroutine).

    The following kinds of identifiers may appear:
    Static: Scope: class.
    Field: Scope: class.
    Argument: Scope: subroutine (method/function/constructor).
    Var: Scope: subroutine (method/function/constructor).

    e.g. x may be stored as name:x type:int kind:field index:0
    e.g. pointCount may be stored as name:pointCount type:int field:static index:0

    When compiling code, any identifier not found in the symbol table may be assumed to be
    a subroutine name or a class name.
